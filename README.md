[Fiery Cushman](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/fiery-cushman) is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, where he directs the Moral Psychology Research Laboratory. His research aims to organize the astonishing complexity of moral judgment around basic functional principles. Much of it is motivated by a simple idea: Because we use punishments and rewards to modify others’ behavior, one function of morality is to teach others how to behave, while another complementary function is to learn appropriate patterns of behavior. His laboratory investigates these issues using a wide range of methods, including surveys, laboratory behavioral studies, psychophysiology, infant and child research, functional neuroimaging, economic games and formal modeling. The ultimate goal is to use the moral domain to understand phenomena of more general importance: the balance between learned and innate contributions to cognition; the human capacity to explain, predict and evaluate others’ behavior; the relationship between automaticity and control; and the architecture of learning and decision-making in a social context. He received his BA and PhD from Harvard University, where he also completed a post-doctoral fellowship.

**Cognitive Foundations of Contractualist Morality** Among scientific theories that attempt to explain the function of morality, a common theme is that morality helps people with disparate interests find mutually beneficial arrangements—the kinds of agreements that they would agree to in negotiation.  The same theme arises in contractualist philosophical theories of morality.   If these theories are right, what cognitive mechanisms help guide our moral judgments towards mutually beneficial agreements?  After all, we cannot literally sit down and bargain over every moral norm.   I will present our recent research on several cognitively efficient mechanisms that approximate the outcome of actual idealized bargaining, and that inform our moral judgments.
